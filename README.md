I think it could be a good idea to document how learning all of this goes.

I'm sure lots of people want to learn how to do this stuff, and if I can do it, and show others how I did, things that worked for me, things that didn't, sources I utilized, things I tried and succeeded, tried and failed.

That could be something useful for those starting on the journy.  Starting with HTML/CSS in a time where there are so many codeless web design apps.  How that affects motivation, and not really understanding if there's value in the time you're using.

Make resources others can use or play off of to learn.

Much easier in a blog form for sure.  Can link to resouces used, talk about how they helped, pro's and cons, etc.
